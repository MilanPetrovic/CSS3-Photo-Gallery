            <h2>About the Gallery</h2>
            <p>I now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. well, what is it today? more spelunking? i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the world.</p>
